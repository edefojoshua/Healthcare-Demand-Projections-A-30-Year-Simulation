The study estimated healthcare demand over a 30-year period using UK hypothetical data for conditions such as hypertension and diabetes in a cohort of 1,000 individuals. In the first phase, data from sources namely CPRD, HES, HSE and CMS were merged, cleaned, and analysed to model hospital visits and lengths of stay. Negative Binomial and linear regression models were employed to identify the factors influencing hospital visits. In the second phase, a microsimulation was conducted to generate a synthetic population, simulating healthcare demand over 30 years while considering estimates of variables such as age, sex, and multimorbidity from the previous phase. The results projected hospital visits and stays for 2025 and 2054 in phase 3. Finally, healthcare costs were estimated by multiplying the length of hospital stays by an assumed rate of Â£250 per hour, applying a discount rate for future costs. These projections provided insights into long-term healthcare demand and associated costs.
